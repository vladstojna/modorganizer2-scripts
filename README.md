# Mod Organizer 2 Scripts

- `modorganizer2-nxm-broker.sh` is a modified version of the one in
  [modorganizer2-linux-installer](https://github.com/rockerbacon/modorganizer2-linux-installer).
- `modorganizer2-standalone.sh` launches MO2 with a standalone Wine prefix.

The `*.desktop` files in `applications/modorganizer2/` require the above scripts
to be in PATH without their file extension.
